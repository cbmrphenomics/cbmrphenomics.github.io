 Overview

The Esrum cluster is a cluster managed by the `Data Analytics Platform`_
(formerly the Phenomics Platform) at CBMR_. Technical support and
administration is handled by KU-IT via the `KU-IT Service portal`_.

**************
 Architecture
**************

The cluster consists of a head node, 8 compute nodes, a container node,
and 1 GPU node:

+---+-----------+------+-------------------------+---------------------+
|   | Node      | RAM  | CPUs                    | GPUs                |
+===+===========+======+=========================+=====================+
| 1 | Head      | 2 TB | 2x24 core AMD EPYC 7413 |                     |
+---+-----------+------+-------------------------+---------------------+
| 8 | Compute   | 2 TB | 2x32 core AMD EPYC 7543 |                     |
+---+-----------+------+-------------------------+---------------------+
| 1 | Container | 2 TB | 2x32 core AMD EPYC 7543 |                     |
+---+-----------+------+-------------------------+---------------------+
| 1 | GPU       | 4 TB | 2x32 core AMD EPYC 75F3 | 2x NVIDIA A100 80GB |
+---+-----------+------+-------------------------+---------------------+

Users connect to the "head" node, from which jobs can be submitted to
the individual compute nodes using the Slurm_ Workload Manager for
running tasks. An :ref:`p_usage_rstudio` web server and a
:ref:`p_usage_shiny` server, both managed by KU-IT, are also available.

**********
 Software
**********

The nodes all run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and a range of scientific
and other software is made available using :ref:`environment modules
<p_usage_modules>`. Missing software can be requested via KU-IT.

**************************
 Projects and data-shares
**************************

Access is managed on a per-project level, and is administrated by the
individual project owners, with each project folder containing a
standard set of sub-folders (``apps``, ``data``, ``people``,
``scratch``).

Datasets used by several projects may made available via read-only
network shares. As with projects, access is administered by the data
owner.

See the respective pages for :ref:`accessing <p_usage_access>` existing
projects/data-shared and for :ref:`creating <p_usage_projects>` new
projects/data-shared.

****************************
 Backup policies and quotas
****************************

Your ``/home`` and the ``apps``. ``data``, and ``people`` folders in
each projects are automatically backed up. The ``scratch`` folders are
NOT backed up. The specific frequency and duration of backups differ for
each type of folder and may also differ for individual projects.

As a rule folders for projects involving GDPR protected data (indicated
by the project name ending with ``-AUDIT``) is subject to more frequent
backups. However, on-site backups are kept for a shorter time to prevent
the unauthorized recovery of intentionally deleted data.

See :ref:`p_usage_filesystem` for more information.

 Applying for access
#####################

The following describes how to apply for access to the Esrum cluster.
You can apply for access to specific projects in the same manner, simply
by substituting ``SRV-esrumhead-users`` with the name of your project.

An `official guide`_ is available here.

#. Visit identity.ku.dk_.

#. Click on the ``Manage My Access`` button or the ``Manage User
   Access`` button. Which of the two buttons you'll see depends on your
   existing roles.

   #. If you clicked on the ``Manage user Access`` button, first search
      for your KU username (e.g. ``abc123``) and then click on the check
      mark to the left of the search result *once*. Wait for the check
      mark to turn green and then click the ``Next`` button.

#. Search for ``SRV-esrumhead-users``.

#. Click *once* on the check mark to the left of ``SRV-esrumhead-users``
   in the resulting list. Wait for the check mark to turn green and then
   click the ``Next`` button.

#. Verify that you are applying for access to ``SRV-esrumhead-users``
   and then click the ``Submit`` button.

#. Wait for your request to be processed.

Once you have been granted access you will receive an email that
``Changes to your Identity were processed``.
